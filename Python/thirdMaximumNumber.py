414. Third Maximum Number

Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

class Solution:
    def thirdMax(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums=list(set(nums))
        nums.sort()
        if len(nums)>2:
            return nums[-3]
        else:
            return nums[-1]
